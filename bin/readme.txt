Precompiled binaries for the Alienwhoop Zero

AlienwhoopZer0_CRSF.hex - intended for Expresslrs , roll&pitch rate 860 /Yaw rate 500

I want to try if Alienshoop zero works with Expresslrs, because the elrs receiver us crossfire protocal.
#define RX_CRSF  
I compiled the defaul frimware to crossfire receiver protocal, and successfuly run EP2 Expresslrs receiver. This receiver is tiny, the best for whoop.
Thanks to the high frame rate, the control feels super agile.

b03-pro_factory_fw.bin - factory firmware for the pro, will also remove alt hold from factory b03
