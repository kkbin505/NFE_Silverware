Precompiled binaries for the bwhoop quad

AlienwhoopZer0_CRSF.hex - intended for expresslrs ,  rate 860/Yaw rate 500

b03-pro_factory_fw.bin - factory firmware for the pro, will also remove alt hold from factory b03

I want to try if Alienshoop zero works with expresslrs, because the elrs receiver us crossfire protocal.
#define RX_CRSF  
I compiled the defaul frimware to crossfire receiver, and successfuly run EP2 Expresslrs receiver. 
Thanks to the high frame rate, the control feels super agile.
